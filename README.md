# workDayPlanner
## Description 
  The goal of this project was to create a place that a busy user would be able to keep track of their schedule for the day. The user is presented with rows representing each "working hour". These rows can be used by the user to input any important meetings, notes to themselves, or a simple to do list. The data the user inputs is saved to local storage so the user won't have to worry about their notes being removed from the screen. Through the implementation of moment.js, the rows will change depending on the time of day so that the user knows which tasks have been completed, what to work on now, and what the rest of their day looks like.
### Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
